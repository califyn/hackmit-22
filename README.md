# CarePigeon

![CarePigeon logo](./frontend/assets/logo.png)

Write notes for your friends and place them around campus. When a friend walks nearby, theyâ€™ll receive your message! 

Created by MIT students Ali Cy, Shreya Chaudhary, and Serena An for HackMIT 2022 (Oct 1-2).

## Getting Started

CarePigeon's frontend is built with a managed workflow on Expo with React Native. 

To make your own version of CarePigeon, clone this repository, go to the ``frontend/`` directory, and type ``npm install``. Then type ``npx expo start --no-dev --minify`` and you're good to go!
